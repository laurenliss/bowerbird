This is a quick data viz of where my former interaction design students currently work. I used a LinkedIn API with some help from a great codebase from Ozgur Vatansever (https://github.com/ozgur/python-linkedin) and this inspiration article from Ahn T. Dang (https://towardsdatascience.com/mining-data-on-linkedin-9b70681b1467)

I have anonymized/removed any first degree personal information (name, location, photo, etc), and only include:
1. industryName
2.
